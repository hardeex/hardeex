Hi, i'm Adewale, a passionate programming student on the journey of becoming full stack developer and a freelance software engineer.  
My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, 
architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

sharing happened through open-source.
